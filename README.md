# Digit-Recognition
This model classifies the handwritten digits based on the pixel values given as features by using SVM with 95.6 accuracy.


A classic problem in the field of pattern recognition is that of handwritten digit recognition. 
We have an image of a digit submitted by a user via a scanner, a tablet, or other digital devices. 
The goal of the above model is to correctly identify the digit (between 0-9) written in an image.
